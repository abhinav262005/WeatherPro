## 📁 Your Repository

**URL:** https://github.com/abhinav262005/WeatherPro

**Name:** WeatherPro

**Description:** 🌤️ Ultimate Weather Dashboard - A stunning, feature-rich weather application with beautiful UI/UX, real-time data, and comprehensive weather visualization

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT - Keep Your Credentials Safe!

Your **real credentials** were removed from `.env`. You'll need them to run the app locally:

```env
DB_PASSWORD=abhinav123
WEATHER_API_KEY=87b986a92d94c6e20cb504026cc6ad76
SESSION_SECRET=a782448193b75ad9e4e7347676e4d7fe95f31682509b8d89bb6b431c58547b0c0495d1cebd887a6a26c388c11d2ab85d86c278f30f23dd37d37a4caed5a03060
```

**Save these somewhere safe!** You'll need to add them back to your local `.env` file after cloning.
